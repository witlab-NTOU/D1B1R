[Delivery ratio]
source, sink, relay = (1,1,100~1000)
dimension = 2000*2000*2000
transmission max = 350
source/sink position setting = 0/0
random seed = 0

(test case)
  relay node = 100 --> delivery ratio = 0%

  relay node = 400 --> delivery ratio = 78%

[Hop count]

(test case)

(special test case)
  dimension = 350*350*350, no collision ---> delivery ratio = 100%, hop count = 1~2

[Energy consumption]

(test case)
  source node (only sending) ~= 24 J consumed  =  120*0.002*100 (theoretical value)
  source node (only idle) ~= 5.7648 J consumed =  0.000008*720600 (theoretical value)
  sink node (only receiving), no collision ~= 9 J consumed (ok) =  120*0.00075*100 (theoretical value)
